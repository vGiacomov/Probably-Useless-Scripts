# 🗃️ Probably Useless Scripts

A collection of small scripts that solve oddly specific problems in oddly specific ways.  
They were written for very particular situations — most of which may never occur again.

But hey, maybe one day they’ll help someone (probably me) save five minutes.

## 📁 Contents

- `python/` – one-off scripts that somehow ended up being reused
- `bash/` – for automating the un-automatable
- `powershell/` – because yes, sometimes Windows needs love too
- `misc/` – everything else that doesn't belong anywhere else

## 🤔 Purpose

This is more of a personal toolbox than a curated collection.  
It’s the kind of stuff you write at 11 PM to fix a problem you never thought you'd have — and might never have again.

## ⚠️ Warning

No guarantees. Some of these scripts are old, some are messy, and some are just plain unnecessary.  
But they worked once. That’s good enough for me.

## 📜 License

MIT – you can do whatever you want with this.  
But if something breaks, crashes, or accidentally emails your boss – not my fault 😎
